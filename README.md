While modification is allowed, one shall not make any modification to this repository unless they have had the permission of the owner of the repository.
If one has a proposal for a change to be made, they must inform the repository owner of it and must not make any change on their own behalf.
In another case, if one desires to make modification to the program, they must do it in a way that does NOT affect the original repository in any way (eg. creating a new repository, offline modification, etc.).

<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
This is a project initiated and conducted by one man, Max Luong (Maak016), stemming from the idea of making a simple game engine in C++ for everyone to use and also for the owner to gain experience for future career development. The owner of the project is (at the time of the initiation of the project) a 10th-Grader who is still relatively inexperienced.
It is to be conceded that this program has many imperfections, but I will endeavor to improve and support it as much and as long as possible.

<h1>PROGRAMMING REFERENCE</h1>
The programming reference is still under construction and will be available soon.
